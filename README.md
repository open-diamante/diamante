# diamante
Open Diamante is an open-source project that creates a community around the use of SUSE software.

Examples include:
- Someone new to SLES who needs to get NRF licenses,
- a team building software on SLE products,
- an engineer wanting to learn about specific SUSE product capabilities.

This project will contain documentation to get people started. That documentation will live here, as AsciiDoc/DAPS.
